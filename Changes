Revision history for Perl extension SNMP::Trapinfo

1.03 2014-09-22
    Added option to hide passwords on read of the packet
    Added rv2gv in Safe compartment, which is needed from perl 5.18 onwards

1.02  2010-09-06
    Added test case for Net-SNMP 5.4.2.1, which has IP in the form: 
      UDP: [10.11.12.13]:4129->[10.10.10.10]
	Assign copyright to Opsera

1.01  2008-02-15
	Add access to 'localtime()' function

1.0   2007-03-20
	If there is more than one trap, you have to use the marker "#---next trap---#\n" between them -
	this does not affect data from snmptrapd as that only sends one trap at a time.
	The marker is required because some traps have embedded linefeeds in the value. This module will
	only read the portion that is on the same line as the key and ignore the rest (unless it
	happens to look like a valid line).

0.92  2006-12-14
	Added safe $trap->eval using Safe.pm module (Rob Moss)
	Operators allowed inside of the eval function are as follows:
	http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.8/ext/Opcode/Opcode.pm
	:base_core :base_mem :base_loop print sprintf prtf padsv padav padhv padany
	In summary:
	Any logic, string/integer comparison, regex and print functions will work
	Any other operator, such as open() exec() unlink() will be denied and the reason given in $@

0.91  2006-09-13
	Small fix for regexp for hide_passwords
	Fix to allow . in the macro names
	Allow * in the macro names as a wildcard for a value between dots
	New method: eval. Expands string and then evals it. Useful for perl-syntax rules

0.90  2006-04-19
	Version number format changed for CPAN

0.8.3 2006-04-06
	Warning: Trailing linefeeds are removed from $trap->packet. Needed for
	consistency
	Can read multiple packets from STDIN
	Can request to hide sensitive information from packet

0.8.2 2006-03-20
	Updated documentation based on advice from Brand Hilton.
	$trap->trapname returns undef if no snmpTrapOID found

0.8.1 2006-03-16
	Net-SNMP 5.2.1 puts extra information around the IP information on line 2
	Parses this correctly now. ${P2} will return the entire line
	Added ${HOSTIP} macro that will strip to just the IP
