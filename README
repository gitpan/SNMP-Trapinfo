SNMP-Trapinfo version 0.8
===========================

This module allows the user to get to the useful parts of an snmptrapd 
packet. This assumes that you are using the Net-SNMP package from 
http://www.net-snmp.org and that you are letting snmptrapd do all the 
OID translations (no -On option for snmptrapd) and that hostnames are 
resolved itself (no -n option).

The most useful method is expand, which evaluates macros based on the 
packet, for your custom messages.


INSTALLATION
